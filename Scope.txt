What is scope? Your explanation should include the idea of global vs. local scope.

	Scope is where a variable is defined. If is defined 	outside of a function, then it has global scope, meaning that you could call the variable any where it would still have its value.  If you define a variable inside of a function, it would have local scope, and you would only be able to call it inside that function.  Meaning with local scope, variables defined inside a function wouldn't effect other code outside the function.

Why are global variables avoided?

Global variables are usually avoided because of the mess that they can create such as a side effect, which is when
 a function reaches outside of its
 local scope to change something or some value in a parent scope.  Having global variables and the
 unintended side effects that they can cause almost
 guarantee code to become indeterminate, meaning with the same inputs the outputs are not
consistant.  This is not something we want and it will make 
code hard to fix.  


Explain JavaScript's strict mode

Using strict mode ensures that a person is declaring variables with const or let, and
if a variable is defined with var, it will throw and error message.  This makes it impossible
to accidentally declare global variables that could mess up other code.


What are side effects, and what is a pure function?

Side effect is when a function reaches outside of its local scope to change something or some value in a parent scope.

'pure functions' are functions that are determinate, meaning that when the same inputs are entered the result is the same, 
and dont have any unintended side effects.
